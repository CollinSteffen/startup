## Elevator Pitch
With so many people wanting to monetize their art and paying for a website themselves is a hard thought option, it is time for a platform to have artists monetize their products and gain the traction they need. My website would allow artists to monetize their products allowing them to actually get the credit they worked hard to achieve.

## Objective
In thinking of how to best demonstrate my expertise of building and running websites, I wanted to create one that would fulfill the elements of the class and be useful to me in the future. The idea for this comes from my love of Photography. I am by no means good at photography, but i can take some pretty decent pictures. Some of these I want to monetize. Although making a page just for me may possibly fulfill all the requirments of the assignment, it might not grow past a few hundred visits in its lifetime. To ensure a steady amount of viewership, i would like to design a page that would serve as a platform for all photographers to post *their* pictures so that they could monetize them without having to create a whole website and advertise their work. While i wont be fleshing out all features of said page, i will continue to improve the website until it could be deployed and fit the requirements of the course and mine own requirements.

## The Page

### The Front Page
The idea with the front page is to show off some of the more *well known* people mixed with the *unknown*. Like music librarys (i.e. *Spotify* and *Apple Music*), They incorporate a homepage that intorduces people that are well known throughout the music world (Drake and Morgan Wallen come to mind). they interweve them with other more obscure artists. To achieve this, we need to make the front page as aesthetically pleasing as possible, making different portraits of artists. There must be blocks that act as a box to be explored.

### The Boxes
When a person clicks on the boxes that highlight the portrait of the artist, they are taken to the profile of the artist. This is customizable by the artists themselves to a degree. like Instagram, they are able to post their art and people are able to look at them. They could contain a **short** blurb/header with the first look of the art.

### Each Specific Post
when someone decides to click on a specific post/art piece, they will be guided to another page where the users are able to read a blog post about the art if they want. There will also be another option to directly buy the piece of art or a print thereof. there will be text boxes outlined, similar to the product pages of Amazon. 

## The Technologies Used

### HTML
Html would be used as the outline and bones of the site itself. When it comes to the page, it would be used to place the boxes in organized positions. It would also be the button and hyperlink body.

### CSS
This would be used specifically to make the site more aesthetically pleasing. The site would be designed and color coded to fit this pleasing nature with the help of this language. The boxes themselves would likely be sized using CSS as they could be strectched or shrunk to fit the size of the screen of the user's technology.

### JavaScript
This would be the script to save data, activate different changes in the webpage, and create little animations depending on what the user in hovering over or initiating.

### Websockets
While the artists would post on their page, all of that data would be stored on the cloud. This would obviously be updated after the class but would be the initial use of the websocket as the consumer/user would navigate to these profiles which are hosted by the server itself.

### Database Data
All artist data, inlcuding **RAW** images. This would be upgraded if the app increases in use and popularity. There will be two different accounts stored, the *users* and the *artists*. Each account bits of data would be stored on the database which the server will pull from in order to provide the products.

### Authentication
Both *Users* and the *artists* will have their own accounts. The *artists* will have a *buisness* account profile that would allow them to be able to post their work and monetize it. The *users* will just have a consumer account that will allow them to search in history and purchase with the card they have already used previously.
