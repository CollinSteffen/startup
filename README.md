## Elevator Pitch
With so many people wanting to monetize their art and paying for a website themselves is a hard thought option, it is time for a platform to have artists monetize their products and gain the traction they need. My website would allow artists to monetize their products allowing them to actually get the credit they worked hard to achieve.

## Objective
In thinking of how to best demonstrate my expertise of building and running websites, I wanted to create one that would fulfill the elements of the class and be useful to me in the future. The idea for this comes from my love of Photography. I am by no means good at photography, but i can take some pretty decent pictures. Some of these I want to monetize. Although making a page just for me may possibly fulfill all the requirments of the assignment, it might not grow past a few hundred visits in its lifetime. To ensure a steady amount of viewership, i would like to design a page that would serve as a platform for all photographers to post *their* pictures so that they could monetize them without having to create a whole website and advertise their work. While i wont be fleshing out all features of said page, i will continue to improve the website until it could be deployed and fit the requirements of the course and mine own requirements.

## The Front Page
The idea with the front page is to show off some of the more *well known* people mixed with the *unknown*. Like music librarys (i.e. *Spotify* and *Apple Music*), They incorporate a homepage that intorduces people that are well known throughout the music world (Drake and Morgan Wallen come to mind). they interweve them with other more obscure artists. To achieve this, we need to make the front page as aesthetically pleasing as possible, making different portraits of artists. There must be blocks that act as a box to be explored.

## the Boxes
When a person clicks on the boxes that highlight the portrait of the artist, they are taken to the profile of the artist. This is customizable by the artists themselves to a degree. like Instagram, they are able to post their art and people are able to look at them. They could contain a **short** blurb/header with the first look of the art.
