## Objective
In thinking of how to best demonstrate my expertise of building and running websites, I wanted to create one that would fulfill the elements of the class and be useful to me in the future. The idea for this comes from my love of Photography. I am by no means good at photography, but i can take some pretty decent pictures. Some of these i want to monetize. Although making a page just for me may possibly fulfill all the requirments of the assignment, it might not grow past a few hundred visits in its lifetime. To ensure a steady amount of viewership, i would like to design a page that would serve as a platform for all photographers to post *their* pictures so that they could monetize them without having to create a whole website and advertise their work. While i wont be fleshing out all features of said page, i will continue to improve the website until it could be deployed and fit the requirements of the course and mine own requirements.
